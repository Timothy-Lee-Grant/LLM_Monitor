# Stage 1 (Design Documentation)

**Direction For This Implementation**
## General Feel

After this implementation the system should be fully wired up in a sustainable and well architectured way to capture, log, and display all telemetry data coming from the system. The telemetry data will be both the standard traditional data (such as latency, error rate, request rate) and traditional data specific to AI systems (token per request, etc). In addition to the traditional metrics and telemetry, our system will also need to produce, collect, report, display, process AI information (LLM as judge, vector database retreival judging, etc).

All of this information will need to be collected and be able to be viewable to the users.

Another thing that I am now thinking about is that we have not yet added tools or memory into this system. This is going to be something that we will also want to have observability for. Therefore in this implementation plan we will need to do it in such a way that allows for easy addition and integration of tools and memory. Maybe this means adding fake stubs, or it means holding off entirely on this implementation plan and working on the tools and memory plan first, then returning to this plan.

### LLM as Judge

This will be to judge the output of the responses which the user gets back for their input. 

Because the LLM is itself a model, I (Timothy) will need to provide human examples as to what kind of responses will be expected and hoped for as responses. When creating this system, give a stub document and indicate where you want me to fill in human information. I think that we will also need a rubric (or maybe what I just described is the rubric itself). I also know that there is a standard of REGAS which we want to follow and implement in this evaluation system.

When implementing this, it will need to be considered carefully from an architectural point of view because as of now our system has a placeholder 'friendly assistant' prompt, but in the future, we will be changing this so that we can have more nuanced and better responses. We might also have different type of message responses based on parameters. So we will need to have our system be able to plan for this.

### Errors to Fix Before Starting Implementation

- When I log onto OpenWebUI, I should only and always connect to my dotnet server. I should only be able to reach my langchain test endpoints with a curl command. (Now I am thinking that I need to look into the architecture on this because is it that we are automatically reporting all endpoint pipelines which we registered to OpenWebUI, because if that is the case then this will be more difficult to change.)

But it should be the case that we are automatically connected with the dotnet endpoints.

- When I first open up my OpenWebUI on my browser, I get spammed with messages telling me that I am connected.
